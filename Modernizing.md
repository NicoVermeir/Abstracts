# Modernizing your legacy application

How do you modernize beyond a 10-30 year legacy?

Too often, organizations rely on applications that have been around for 10+ years. These applications are maintained on an "as needed" basis and may represent a single point of failure, and those failures are expensive.

But how do you modernize over 10 years of legacy? Throw it all out and start over? That gets even more expensive. The answer is simple: it depends. 

It depends on the specific needs of the business: does it need to scale? What about safety or privacy? How about Performance? Choices have to be made.

As an application modernization architect I have done my fair share of these projects. In this session I will share my experiences, and how I deal with them. By the end of the session you will have a clear understanding of where to start, and what steps to take to bring that business-critical application into the modern age.
